                    We all know Google Translate and all the fancy translation
                    services the internet has to offer. Therefore we also know
                    how awful these services can be. Missing the context and
                    producing translations that isn't right. These services
                    often ONLY work in short sentences, from a specific language
                    to a specific language. What if we gave an expert the
                    opportunity to look through your text, and come with a valid
                    translation based on his knowledge? That is what Ordsome is
                    for - to make people help eachother with translation whether
                    is a single word or letters from a unknown relative.

                <div class="headline mt-3">How does it work?</div>
                <p class="subheading mt-3">
                    Ordsome is split in to two parts - the possibility to ask
                    for a translation and the possibility to answer a
                    translation. To answer a translation you have to register
                    and here you will have to point out what kind of languages
                    you know. Afterwards you will be able to translate
                    translation asked by people all around the globe.
                </p>

                <p class="subheading mt-3">
                    However if you want somebody to help with a translation you
                    can, in totally anonymity, ask for help. Here it will be
                    possible for you to set your preferred answer. Your requests
                    will be linked to your personal ID. Therefore it is
                    important that if you were to change your device to save
                    your personal ID. If you choose to register, the personal ID
                    will be saved with your username.
